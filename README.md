# Sudoku-solver
[C] Sudoku solver v1.0 coded by Freezing 14/01/2020

Basic C program that reads 9x9 sudoku board from stdin, solves it by using recursive backtracking algorithm and prints the solution in a neat format on stdout.

Keep in mind that this code may not be optimal, it's just something I made in my free time as a practice. I'm still learning :).
