# Sudoku solver
[C] Sudoku solver v1.1 - coded by Freezing 03/02/2020 (updated version from 14/01/2020)

Basic C program that reads 9x9 sudoku board from .txt file, solves it by using recursive backtracking algorithm and prints the solution in a neat format on stdout and writes it into designated .txt file.

Keep in mind that this code may not be optimal, it's just something I made in my free time as a practice. I'm still learning :).

Feel free to share/criticise the code.
